CODE CHALLENGE: LOOPS
Exponents
exponents(bases, powers)

Instructions
1.
Create a function named exponents() that takes two lists as parameters named bases and powers. Return a new list containing every number in bases raised to every number in powers.

For example, consider the following code.

exponents([2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3])
the result would be the list [2, 4, 8, 3, 9, 27, 4, 16, 64]. It would first add two to the first. Then two to the second. Then two to the third, and so on.


Hint
Use nested for loops. The outer for loop should loop through all of the bases and the inner for loop should loop through all of the powers.

Remember a ** b is a to the power of b

problem
#Write your function here


#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
#print(exponents([2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3]))


solution 

#Write your function here
def exponents(bases, powers):
  new_lst = []
  for base in bases:
    for power in powers:
      new_lst.append(base ** power)
  return new_lst
