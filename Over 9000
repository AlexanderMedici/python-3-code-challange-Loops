CODE CHALLENGE: LOOPS
Over 9000
over_nine_thousand(lst)

Instructions
1.
Create a function named over_nine_thousand() that takes a list of numbers named lst as a parameter.

The function should sum the elements of the list until the sum is greater than 9000. When this happens, the function should return the sum. If the sum of all of the elements is never greater than 9000, the function should return total sum of all the elements. If the list is empty, the function should return 0.

For example, if lst was [8000, 900, 120, 5000], then the function should return 9020.


Hint
Create a variable named sum that begins at 0. Loop through all of the elements of lst and use a break when the sum is greater than 9000. Return sum after the loop.
