CODE CHALLENGE: LOOPS
Larger Sum
larger_sum(lst1, lst2)

Instructions
1.
Create a function named larger_sum() that takes two lists of numbers as parameters named lst1 and lst2.

The function should return the list whose elements sum to the greater number. If the sum of the elements of each list are equal, return lst1.


Hint
Create variables named sum1 and sum2 and set them to be 0. Loop through each list separately and add to the appropriate variable. After looping through each list, compare the two sums in an if statement and return the correct list.

problem 
#Write your function here


#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
#print(larger_sum([1, 9, 5], [2, 3, 7]))

solution 

#Write your function here
def larger_sum(lst1, lst2):
  sum1 = 0
  sum2 = 0
  for number in lst1:
    sum1 += number
  for number in lst2:
    sum2 += number
  if sum1 >= sum2:
    return lst1
  else: 
    return lst2

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(larger_sum([1, 9, 5], [2, 3, 7]))
