ODE CHALLENGE: LOOPS
Delete Starting Even Numbers
delete_starting_evens(lst)

Instructions
1.
Write a function called delete_starting_evens() that has a parameter named lst.

The function should remove elements from the front of lst until the front of the list is not even. The function should then return lst.

For example if lst started as [4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15], then delete_starting_evens(lst) should return [11, 12, 15].

Make sure your function works even if every element in the list is even!


Hint
Use a while loop to check two things. First, check if the list has at least one element, using len(lst). Second, check to see if the first element is odd using mod (%). If both of those are True, slice off the first element of the list using lst = lst[1:].

problem 
#Write your function here


#Uncomment the lines below when your function is done
#print(delete_starting_evens([4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15]))

#Write your function here

def delete_starting_evens(lst):
  while (len(lst) > 0 and lst[0] % 2 == 0):
    lst = lst[1:]
  return lst

#Uncomment the lines below when your function is done
print(delete_starting_evens([4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15]))
print(delete_starting_evens([4, 8, 10]))
