CODE CHALLENGE: LOOPS
Odd Indices
odd_indices(lst)

Instructions
1.
Create a function named odd_indices() that has one parameter named lst.

The function should create a new empty list and add every element from lst that has an odd index. The function should then return this new list.

For example, odd_indices([4, 3, 7, 10, 11, -2]) should return the list [3, 10, -2].


Hint
There are a few ways to do this. range(1, len(lst), 2) will create a list of the indices you’re interested in. So you could loop through that list like this:

for index in range(1, len(lst), 2):
  new_list.append(lst[index])

#Write your function here


#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
#print(odd_indices([4, 3, 7, 10, 11, -2]))

solution 

#Write your function here
def odd_indices(lst):
  new_lst = []
  for index in range(1, len(lst), 2):
    new_lst.append(lst[index])
  return new_lst

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(odd_indices([4, 3, 7, 10, 11, -2]))
