CODE CHALLENGE: LOOPS
Divisible by Ten
divisible_by_ten(nums)

Instructions
1.
Create a function named divisible_by_ten() that takes a list of numbers named nums as a parameter.

Return the count of how many numbers in the list are divisible by 10.


Hint
Create a counter that starts at 0. Inside the loop, whenever you find a number divisible by ten, add 1 to that counter.

x is divisible by ten if x % 10 == 0 is True.
