ODE CHALLENGE: LOOPS
Introduction
This lesson will help you review Python functions by providing some challenge exercises involving loops.

As a refresher, function syntax looks like this:

def some_function(some_input1, some_input2):
  … do something with the inputs …
  return output
For example, a function that prints all odd numbers in a list would look like this:

def odd_nums(lst):
  for item in lst:
    if item % 2 == 1:
      print(item)
And this would produce output like:

>>> odd_nums([4, 7, 9, 10, 13])
7
9
13
When you’re ready to do this series of short function challenges, continue on to the rest of the lesson!
