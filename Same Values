CODE CHALLENGE: LOOPS
Same Values
same_values(lst1, lst2)

Instructions
1.
Write a function named same_values() that takes two lists of numbers of equal size as parameters.

The function should return a list of the indices where the values were equal in lst1 and lst2.

For example, the following code should return [0, 2, 3]

same_values([5, 1, -10, 3, 3], [5, 10, -10, 3, 5])

Hint
Loop through all of the indices of each list using for index in range(len(lst1)) and compare lst1[index] to lst2[index]. Append index to a new list if those two items are equal.

  new_lst = []
  for index in range(len(lst1)):
    if lst1[index] == lst2[index]:
      new_lst.append(index)
