CODE CHALLENGE: LOOPS
Max Num
max_num(nums)

Instructions
1.
Create a function named max_num() that takes a list of numbers named nums as a parameter.

The function should return the largest number in nums


Hint
Create a variable called maximum to track the max number, and have it start as the first element in the list. Loop through all of the numbers in the list, and if a number is ever greater than the current max number, the max number should be re-set to that number.
